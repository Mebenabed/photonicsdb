DEPHINE is an online application that allows the creation and management of technical components or items and their related specifications data. The operations to create objects are restricted to a pre-defined model, and by doing so, data is structured into multi-level classifications, enabling thereafter a user-friendly browsing experience guided by objects’ modeling elements. In simple terms, DEPHINE hosts records that are characterized by particular specifications and allows to fetch these records by means of their specifications; it is flexible since records and records’ specifications are defined by the end-user.

The original intended use of DEPHINE is to collect all foundries, foundry processes, and process building blocks available for the development of photonic integrated circuits.
