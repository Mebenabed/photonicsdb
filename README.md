Dephine is an ORM based web application that was developped in order to provide a database for the non-standardized industry of photonics where standards (mainly classes and parameters) of technical components ((building) block) need to be defined and tracked (and filtered) by manufacturing data (foundries and processes).

## Usage ##
Clone or download and run **npm install**, MongoDB acts as a data store through 4 collections that needs to be created : 'foundries', 'blocks', 'definitions' and 'components'. Run **node app** to start the app listening to port :3000

Note: This app is functioning correctly, however, updates might take place in the future as this is not the final version.
